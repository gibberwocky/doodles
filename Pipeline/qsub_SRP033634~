# Apis mellifera intermissa (Buttel-Reepen, 1906) is the native honeybee subspecies of Algeria. A.m.intermissa occurs in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, between the Atlas and the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts (Ruttner, 1988), in an area of more than 2500 km long. Intermissa indicates the position through this bee races between tropical Africa and European breeds (Peyvel, 1994). The settlement area of the Tellian extends from Tunisia to Morocco. Ruttner et al (1978) describes the pure Tellian. It is a black hair of his coat poverty brings out the black color. It is a small size, there are some times light illumination on the tergites. This bee is very aggressive, nervous, sick to take part, as swarms huge fall and even produced many brood and can build up to one hundred queen cells (Le Conte, 2002). A.m.intermissa is prone to swarming, shows an defensive behaviour and an abundant use of propolis (Ruttner 1988). Extraction had been done of Leg samples by Qiagen Blood & Tissue Mini kit.Then sequencing done at Illumina GAIIX Sequencer. Assembly of the reads done and contigs are generated.Contigs were assembled to scaffolding and draft Genome of Algerian bee formed.AGP file were made for submission.
